# Project: RLR-Audio-Propagation

This project hosts the binaries and headers for the audio propagation engine used in [sound-spaces](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sound-spaces). This is used as a git-submodule in the [habitat-sim](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim) for the low-level audio rendering. The high-level task APIs are maintained in sound-spaces.
